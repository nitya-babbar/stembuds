                    <h2>COVID-19 CHANGES</h2>
                    <p>Due to COVID-19, the Nashua schools are currently fully remote. However, we did not want this to prevent students from extending their STEM experiences and stop them from bonding with our high school volunteers. So, we are currently holding Zoom sessions for one hour a week for all students that are a part of STEMBuds. During this time, STEMBuds students are using Scratch, and developing projects of their own. Scratch is a great introduction to coding. We believe that learning to code instills great analytical thinking and problem solving skills in students. Students are getting 1 on 1 attention to connect with a high school mentor and design their own Scratch projects. All STEMBuds volunteers are well versed in Scratch to help students develop a project of their imaginations.</p>
